About Me



\###Part E: Reflection



The most challenging part was working with Git Terminal, while the easiest part was editing the README via web access. Everything was new to me, and I had always wanted to learn about GitHub, now U  have learned the basic I'm very exited to keep learning more. Using the command line for these tasks was a little challenging, but I believe that anything new feels difficult at first, With more practice, I'll be just fine.
